                    <p class="text-white mb-5" style="text-align: justify;">
                        4Data Driven did not start with values. We were “born” with people, with mistakes, with
                        successes, with sweat, with sleepless nights, with exciting moments, with fear, with risk and
                        even with a different name. But not with values.
                        <br><br>
                        Nobody sat down and said: “From tomorrow on, we will do it this way”. Nor was there any talk of
                        “mission”, “vision”... It wasn’t like that. We know that this is the first thought when most
                        companies are born “on which pillars we will base our actions”... wow, here we are far from
                        that.
                        <br><br>
                        And if you think about it, 4Data Driven wasn’t even born, it “just happened”. There wasn’t a day
                        when we sat down and toasted the beginning of the company. We don’t even have an anniversary
                        date. It happened, and suddenly... it was there, existing... “It had been!”, and how “it had
                        been” and it was, and it is being beautiful, but to be born? Ah... it didn’t happen.
                        <br><br>
                        And without any inauguration, everything just happened. The clients came, the logo, a lot of
                        work, and fear, and sweat, and risk, and people. And more and more people. And exchanges, and
                        feedback, and joy, and tears, and celebrations. And suddenly, in the midst of all this, it
                        became clear, so clear and so obvious: our values ​​are here, and no one told us what they would
                        be, they were!
                        <br><br>
                        And what comes next was never spoken about, but suddenly it seemed so familiar to us... so each
                        one of us, so each of our actions, so within the emotions that we experience every day... so
                        natural that... are you serious that we haven't talked about this yet?
                        <br><br>
                        So here we go. Call it whatever you want, perfectionism, detail-oriented, boring, but the client
                        WILL smile when they open one of our PPTs, one of our dashboards, one of our analysis, one of
                        our spreadsheets or even a WhatsApp message. They will feel “loved by us”, lol. They will feel
                        that we took our time to deliver something that is a pleasure to see, that no matter how small
                        the complexity, we made it with care. And... speaking of affection, again, call it whatever you
                        want, but here we will look at each other and, no matter how much the rush of everyday life can
                        overshadow us, we will see that behind each professional, there is a human being with problems,
                        with a family, with pain, with joy, and we will support each other and know that we are in this
                        together, people. And... call all this whatever you want, here at 4Data Driven we will call it
                        CARE. Care with delivery, care with each other.
                        <br><br>
                        Is it WILL that speaks? When we cannot accept not being able to achieve something, when we
                        search the internet and think “there is no way that no one has ever had this problem”, when we
                        do not know exactly how to do it, but we know that we will do it (and we will do it very well!),
                        and it is not because we are better than anyone else, but we know how we want it. And what are
                        the limits for those who are willing? For those who are eager? For those who really want it? For
                        those who know how good it is to see something we built, beautiful, in front of us. For those
                        who know how good it is to unlock a code, for those who know how good it is to look at an
                        analysis and say “I did that?”... and how much satisfaction it is when a client says “WOW!”.
                        What is the limit of knowledge for those who are willing to learn? Willingness is for those who
                        know what is good. And we enjoy good things around here.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, we know here that there is no such thing as a 4Data Driven person, it is a great mix
                        and construction of the best of each one of us, so let's “go for it” every day because nothing
                        will happen if we don't face it. Facing problems because “leave it to me, this is my problem”,
                        facing our fears, often facing our comfort zone, facing frustration, an emotion! Let's face
                        everything and know that behind other screens other people are “facing” something, today, too,
                        and no one is alone. And we could call this “let’s go for it” and “this is my problem” many
                        things, but let’s call it ATTITUDE. Because we here are full of that... attitude, and that moves
                        us forward every day.
                        <br><br>
                        CARE, WILLINGNESS AND ATTITUDE. What do we lack, people? Give us the DATA and we will go further
                        and further and we will make this company happen, every day, in an incredible way!
